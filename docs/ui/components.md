# Components

Components are reusable blocks of UI for building applications with Aena. They are functions including a special HTML-like syntax called [TSX](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html), directly in TypeScript. You can use this syntax in `.tsx` files if the [`jsx` option](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#jsx) in your tsconfig is enabled (if you used the installation guide, this option is enabled):

```tsx
