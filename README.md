Aena is your next SPA TypeScript framework.

## This Package Does _Not_ Throw!

There are no throw expressions in `aena` because I believe that errors should be handled via returns types.
Also `try-catch` blocks have the worst syntax.

## Thanks

Huge thanks to [SolidJS](https://github.com/solidjs/solid/tree/main/packages/solid) for the types because extracting the types from specifications is very tedious. I also thank [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) for inspiration for the quickstart guide.
